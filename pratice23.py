#question 28. This program prints the for and while loop infinitely 

def infinite_while_loop():
    while True:
        print("This is a infinite while loop")
infinite_while_loop()


#this is for_loop

#from itertools import cycle
#def infinite_for_loop():
  #  for item in cycle(["This is an infinite for loop!"]):
    #    print(item)
#infinite_for_loop()

#im commenting it because any one of the loop can be run at one time because this is a infinite process
